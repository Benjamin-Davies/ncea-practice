      <h1>Can't Think of a Poem</h1>
      <p>
        One day at a pet shop,<br>
        I met a man selling cats,<br>
        For money he wanted to swap,<br>
        But I really wanted some lattes.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Got any lattes?" asked I.<br>
        "For that's how I'll spend my money."<br>
        "No lattes here!" said the guy.<br>
        He seemed to find it quite funny.
      </p>
      <p>
        "We've got some lovely dogs,<br>
        I'll give you a very fine price."<br>
        "I'd rather have some frogs."<br>
        The man blinked rapidly thrice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The man seemed exceptionally small,<br>
        And his manner was strangely amused.<br>
        He wasn't what I would call banal,<br>
        Great disdain he noticeably oozed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like others, he thought I was odd,<br>
        Some say I'm a bit cheeky.<br>
        Still he gave me a courteous nod,<br>
        As if he thought I was plenty geeky.
      </p>
      <p>
        So in search of my goal I departed,<br>
        But before the pet shop could I leave,<br>
        The man came running full-hearted,<br>
        "I can help you I believe."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Cats, lattes, you shall find.<br>
        Dogs, frogs, you can get.<br>
        You must now open your mind,<br>
        And get down to Green Way Market.
      </p>
      <p>
        So to Green Way Market I decided to go,<br>
        In search of the lattes I craved.<br>
        The winds it did eerily blow.<br>
        But I felt that the day could be saved.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were stalls selling rings,<br>
        Sushi in many shades.<br>
        There were even stalls selling wings<br>
        People were scattered from many trades
      </p>
      <p>
        I was greeted by a peculiar lady,<br>
        She seemed to be rather cheeky<br>
        I couldn't help thinking she might be quite shady.<br>
        I wondered if she was at all geeky.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before I could open my mouth,<br>
        She shouted, "For you, I have some lattes!"<br>
        I headed towards her, to the south,<br>
        Past some dogs and cats.
      </p>
      <p>
        "But how did you know?" I asked,<br>
        "Do you want them or not?" she did say.<br>
        Silently, the lattes she passed.<br>
        Then vanished before I could pay.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I walked away I hard a crackle<br>
        Or was it, perhaps, a hushed cackle?
